              <p>Who created 5G?</p>
<p>5G technology is developed by many different companies and organizations around the world through the cooperation of the standardization organization 3GPP. 5G is a global open standard, which means that anyone can understand its working principles and requirements. Global 5G standardization ensures that devices and networks can work together, making a major contribution to the development of 5G, especially in areas related to ultra-simplified radio design, security and user privacy, network slicing, and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>5G and traffic</p>
<p>Changing the transportation system to respond to trends such as increased traffic demand, density, and urbanization, while also responding to the challenge of radically reducing emissions and environmental impact, is facing tremendous pressure.</p>
<p>5G plays a key role in the transformation by connecting vehicles, roadside infrastructure and the digitization of the entire transportation system. Through real-time information sharing on the 5G network, vehicles will learn about traffic conditions, thereby optimizing traffic and minimizing congestion. This reduces travel time and emissions, and the instant sharing of data allows vehicles to actually see the corners, improving everyone's safety.</p>
<p>5G makes this possible by supporting extremely high device densities, millisecond response times, and the ability to create dedicated network slices for traffic infrastructure.</p>
<p>5G and gaming</p>
<p>The gaming industry is by far the largest entertainment industry, with total revenue in 2020 of approximately US$180 billion. Mobile games are the fastest growing category, now accounting for nearly 50% of revenue. Consumers like mobile games, and 5G will further promote this.</p>
<p>Capacity, speed, and millisecond ping allow you to play advanced games anytime, anywhere. 5G brings the capacity needed to stream massively multiplayer games, including immersive experiences in augmented reality.</p>
<p>Thanks to the network processing, future devices can be lighter, while still having a longer battery life. This also means that as new games are released, the need to update equipment will decrease, making advanced mobile games more accessible.</p>
<p>5G and agriculture</p>
<p>The need to feed a growing population, water shortages in many parts of the world, and the need to sustainably use less fertilizers and reduce environmental impact to increase crop yields-the agricultural sector faces many challenges.</p>
<p>5G helps meet these challenges by accelerating the digitalization of agriculture and connecting all aspects of business. The miniature soil sensor can measure watering and fertilization needs to minimize usage, and the battery life of the battery connected to 5G can be up to 10 years.</p>
<p>The same network can also connect self-driving agricultural robots with mission-critical connections, making them autonomous and coordinated, thereby increasing productivity and safety.<br>
